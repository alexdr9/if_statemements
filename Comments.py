# -------------- day 7

# comments are made by using the hash key, this is mostly for annotating your work so other developers better understand
# the code that you have written and what it does exactly

'''
Another way of writing comments is to use triple single quotation marks to open
and close
your comment
'''


# code can be 'commented out' as below to see if the line is causing any errors

# print("This code is not working")...
