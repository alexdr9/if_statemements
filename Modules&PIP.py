# modules are python files that we can import into a new or existing project. The modules contain functions, variables
# and other stored data that can be used in a project after being imported.

import input                        # imports all variables, functions, etc. from the input.py file

# PIP is used to install python modules from other sources

# e.g. in terminal type    pip install python-docx
# this will install a 3rd party module to create functions that work with microsoft word

# PIP files are stored in external libraries > python3.10>site-packages
